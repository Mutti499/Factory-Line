# Factory-Line

In Rumeli Hisarüstü, a factory called 1-A Factory produces essential products. Every product has their respective value. In the factory, individual units called holders are responsible for handling the products in the factory line. Each holder is coupled with the previous and the next holder to create a product line. I am tasked with the organization of this product line.
